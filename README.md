# SocialNetAPI

## About
### In this module I attempted to build an API for a social network application that allows users to share their thoughts and create a friends list. I have also already laid some of the ground work for User reactions though I haven't got it working yet.

## Built Using: Express, MongoDB, and JS. Tested using Insomnia
